# Claude Bootstrap

> An opinionated project initialization system for Claude Code. Security-first, spec-driven, AI-native.

**The bottleneck has moved from code generation to code comprehension.** AI can generate infinite code, but humans still need to review, understand, and maintain it. Claude Bootstrap provides guardrails that keep AI-generated code simple, secure, and verifiable.

## Why This Exists

After hundreds of AI-assisted projects across Node, React, Python, and React Native, patterns emerged:

1. **Engineers struggle with Claude Code not because of the tool, but because of how they instruct it** - The delta is in the guardrails
2. **Complexity has a ceiling** - There's a point where AI loses coherent understanding of the system. That's a signal, not a failure
3. **Restart is a feature, not failure** - When fixing something increases complexity, restart with learnings. Each iteration is faster

This toolkit encodes those learnings into reusable skills.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/alinaqi/claude-bootstrap.git ~/.claude-bootstrap
cd ~/.claude-bootstrap && ./install.sh

# In any project directory
claude
> /initialize-project
```

Claude will:
1. **Validate tools** - Check gh, vercel, supabase CLIs
2. **Ask questions** - Language, framework, AI-first?, database
3. **Set up repository** - Create or connect GitHub repo
4. **Create structure** - Skills, security, CI/CD, specs, todos
5. **Prompt for specs** - Transition to defining first feature

## Philosophy

### Complexity is the Enemy

Every line of code is a liability. The goal is software simple enough that any engineer (or AI) can understand the entire system in one session.

**Measurable constraints, not vague guidance:**

| Constraint | Limit |
|------------|-------|
| Lines per function | 20 max |
| Parameters per function | 3 max |
| Nesting depth | 2 levels max |
| Lines per file | 200 max |
| Test coverage | 80% minimum |

### Security is Non-Negotiable

- No secrets in code - ever
- No secrets in `VITE_*` or `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` env vars (client-exposed!)
- `.env` files always gitignored
- Dependency scanning on every PR
- Pre-commit security checks

### Centralized Credentials

Store all your API keys in one file (e.g., `~/Documents/Access.txt`):

```
OpenAI API: sk-proj-xxx
Claude API: sk-ant-xxx
Stripe: sk_test_xxx
Supabase url: https://xxx.supabase.co
Anon key: eyJxxx
```

When starting a project, Claude asks for your access file location, auto-detects keys by pattern, validates them, and creates your `.env`.

### AI-First Architecture

For applications where LLMs handle core logic:

- **LLM for logic, code for plumbing** - Classification, extraction, decisions via LLM; validation, routing, auth via code
- **Test LLM calls properly** - Mocks for unit tests, fixtures for parsing, evals for accuracy
- **Track costs** - Monitor token usage and latency

### Spec-Driven Development

Define before you build:

1. **Feature specs** in `_project_specs/features/`
2. **Atomic todos** with validation criteria and test cases
3. **Move, don't delete** - Completed todos go to `completed.md` for reference

```

## Quality Gates

Every project gets automated enforcement:

### Pre-Commit (Local)
- Linting with auto-fix
- Type checking
- Security checks (no secrets, no .env)
- Unit tests on changed files

### CI (GitHub Actions)
- Full lint + type check
- All tests with 80% coverage
- Secret scanning (trufflehog)
- Dependency audit (npm audit / safety)

## Atomic Todos

All work is tracked with validation and test cases:

```markdown
## [TODO-042] Add email validation to signup form

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** high
**Estimate:** S

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Email field shows error for invalid format
- [ ] Form cannot submit with invalid email

### Validation
- Manual: Enter "notanemail", verify error
- Automated: `npm test -- --grep "email validation"`

### Test Cases
| Input | Expected |
|-------|----------|
| user@example.com | Valid |
| notanemail | Error |
```
