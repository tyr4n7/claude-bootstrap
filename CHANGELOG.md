## [2.0.0] - 2026-01-08

### Breaking Changes
- **Skills structure changed** - Skills now use folder/SKILL.md structure instead of flat .md files
  - Before: `~/.claude/skills/base.md`
  - After: `~/.claude/skills/base/SKILL.md`
- All skills now require YAML frontmatter with `name` and `description` fields

### Added
- **Validation test** (`tests/validate-structure.sh`) - Validates skills structure, commands, hooks
  - `--full` mode: All 142 checks
  - `--quick` mode: Essential checks for initialize-project
- **Phase 0 validation** in `/initialize-project` - Checks bootstrap installation before setup
- **Conversion script** (`scripts/convert-skills-structure.sh`) - Migrates flat skills to folder structure
- Install script now runs validation automatically
- Symlink created at `~/.claude-bootstrap` for easy access to validation tools

### Fixed
- Skills now load properly in Claude Code (fixes #1)
- Install script properly copies skill folders instead of merging contents

### Migration
```bash
cd ~/.claude-bootstrap
git pull
./install.sh
```
