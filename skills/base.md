# Base Skill - Universal Patterns

## Core Principle

Complexity is the enemy. Every line of code is a liability. The goal is software simple enough that any engineer (or AI) can understand the entire system in one session.

---

## Simplicity Rules

### Function Level
- **Maximum 20 lines per function** - if longer, decompose
- **Maximum 3 parameters per function** - if more, use an options object or decompose
- **Maximum 2 levels of nesting** - flatten with early returns or extract functions
- **Single responsibility** - each function does exactly one thing
- **Descriptive names over comments** - if you need a comment to explain what, rename it

### File Level
- **Maximum 200 lines per file** - if longer, split by responsibility
- **Maximum 10 functions per file** - keeps cognitive load manageable
- **One export focus per file** - a file should have one primary purpose

### Module Level
- **Maximum 3 levels of directory nesting** - flat is better than nested
- **Clear boundaries** - each module has a single public interface
- **No circular dependencies** - ever

---

## Architectural Patterns

### Functional Core, Imperative Shell
- Pure functions for business logic - no side effects, deterministic
- Side effects only at boundaries - API calls, database, file system at edges
- Data in, data out - functions transform data, they don't mutate state

### Composition Over Inheritance
- No inheritance deeper than 1 level - prefer interfaces/composition
- Small, composable utilities - build complex from simple
- Dependency injection - pass dependencies, don't import them directly

### Error Handling
- Fail fast, fail loud - errors surface immediately
- No silent failures - every error is logged or thrown
- Design APIs where misuse is impossible

---

## Testing Philosophy

- **100% coverage on business logic** - the functional core
- **Integration tests for boundaries** - API endpoints, database operations
- **No untested code merges** - CI blocks without passing tests
- **Test behavior, not implementation** - tests survive refactoring
- **Each test runs in isolation** - no interdependence

---

## Anti-Patterns (Never Do This)

- ❌ Global state
- ❌ Magic numbers/strings - use named constants
- ❌ Deep nesting - flatten or extract
- ❌ Long parameter lists - use objects
- ❌ Comments explaining "what" - code should be self-documenting
- ❌ Dead code - delete it, git remembers
- ❌ Copy-paste duplication - extract to shared function
- ❌ God objects/files - split by responsibility
- ❌ Circular dependencies
- ❌ Premature optimization
- ❌ Large PRs - small, focused changes only
- ❌ Mixing refactoring with features - separate commits

---

## Documentation Structure

Every project must have clear separation between code docs and project specs:

```
project/
├── docs/                      # Code documentation
│   ├── architecture.md        # System design decisions
│   ├── api.md                 # API reference (if applicable)
│   └── setup.md               # Development setup guide
├── _project_specs/            # Project specifications
│   ├── overview.md            # Project vision and goals
│   ├── features/              # Feature specifications
│   │   ├── feature-a.md
│   │   └── feature-b.md
│   ├── todos/                 # Atomic todos tracking
│   │   ├── active.md          # Current sprint/focus
│   │   ├── backlog.md         # Future work
│   │   └── completed.md       # Done items (for reference)
│   ├── session/               # Session state (see session-management.md)
│   │   ├── current-state.md   # Live session state
│   │   ├── decisions.md       # Key decisions log
│   │   ├── code-landmarks.md  # Important code locations
│   │   └── archive/           # Past session summaries
│   └── prompts/               # LLM prompt specifications (if AI-first)
└── CLAUDE.md                  # Claude instructions (references skills)
```

### What Goes Where

| Location | Content |
|----------|---------|
| `docs/` | Technical documentation, API refs, setup guides |
| `_project_specs/` | Business logic, features, requirements, todos |
| `_project_specs/session/` | Session state, decisions, context for resumability |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Claude-specific instructions and skill references |

---

## Atomic Todos

All work is tracked as atomic todos with validation and test criteria.

### Todo Format (Required)
```markdown
## [TODO-001] Short descriptive title

**Status:** pending | in-progress | blocked | done
**Priority:** high | medium | low
**Estimate:** XS | S | M | L | XL

### Description
One paragraph describing what needs to be done.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Criterion 1 - specific, measurable
- [ ] Criterion 2 - specific, measurable

### Validation
How to verify this is complete:
- Manual: [steps to manually test]
- Automated: [test file/command that validates this]

### Test Cases
| Input | Expected Output | Notes |
|-------|-----------------|-------|
| ... | ... | ... |

### Dependencies
- Depends on: [TODO-xxx] (if any)
- Blocks: [TODO-yyy] (if any)
```

### Todo Rules
1. **Atomic** - Each todo is a single, completable unit of work
2. **Testable** - Every todo has validation criteria and test cases
3. **Sized** - If larger than "M", break it down further
4. **Independent** - Minimize dependencies between todos
5. **Tracked** - Move between active.md → completed.md when done

### Example Atomic Todo
```markdown
## [TODO-042] Add email validation to signup form

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** high
**Estimate:** S

### Description
Validate email format on the signup form before submission. Show inline error if invalid.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Email field shows error for invalid format
- [ ] Error clears when user fixes the email
- [ ] Form cannot submit with invalid email
- [ ] Valid emails pass through without error

### Validation
- Manual: Enter "notanemail" in signup form, verify error appears
- Automated: `npm test -- --grep "email validation"`

### Test Cases
| Input | Expected Output | Notes |
|-------|-----------------|-------|
| user@example.com | Valid, no error | Standard email |
| user@sub.example.com | Valid, no error | Subdomain |
| notanemail | Invalid, show error | No @ symbol |
| user@ | Invalid, show error | No domain |
| @example.com | Invalid, show error | No local part |

### Dependencies
- Depends on: [TODO-041] Signup form component
- Blocks: [TODO-045] Signup flow integration test
```

## Security (Non-Negotiable)

Every project must meet these security requirements. See `security.md` skill for detailed patterns.

### Essential Security Checks
1. **No secrets in code** - Use environment variables, never commit secrets
2. **`.env` in `.gitignore`** - Always, no exceptions
3. **No secrets in client-exposed env vars** - Never use `VITE_*`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` for secrets
4. **Validate all input** - Use Zod/Pydantic at API boundaries
5. **Parameterized queries only** - No string concatenation for SQL
6. **Hash passwords properly** - bcrypt with 12+ rounds
7. **Dependency scanning** - npm audit / safety check must pass

### Required Files
- `.gitignore` with secrets patterns
- `.env.example` with all required vars (no values)
- `scripts/security-check.sh` for pre-commit validation

### Security in CI
Every PR must pass:
- Secret scanning (detect-secrets / trufflehog)
- Dependency audit (npm audit / safety)
- Static analysis (CodeQL)

---

## Quality Gates (Non-Negotiable)

### Coverage Threshold
- **Minimum 80% code coverage** - CI must fail below this
- Business logic (core/) should aim for 100%
- Integration tests cover boundaries

### Pre-Commit Hooks
All projects must have pre-commit hooks that run:
1. Linting (auto-fix where possible)
2. Type checking
3. Tests (at minimum, affected tests)

This catches issues before they hit CI, saving time and keeping the main branch clean.

---

## Session Management (Non-Negotiable)

Maintain context for resumability. See `session-management.md` for full details.

### Core Rule: Checkpoint at Natural Breakpoints

After completing any task, ask:
1. **Decision made?** → Log to `_project_specs/session/decisions.md`
2. **>10 tool calls?** → Full checkpoint to `current-state.md`
3. **Major feature done?** → Archive to `session/archive/`
4. **Otherwise** → Quick update to `current-state.md`

### Session Start
1. Read `_project_specs/session/current-state.md`
2. Check `_project_specs/todos/active.md`
3. Continue from documented "Next Steps"

### Session End
1. Archive current session
2. Update `current-state.md` with handoff notes
3. Ensure next steps are specific and actionable

---

## Response Format

When implementing features:
1. Clarify requirements if ambiguous
2. Propose structure first - outline before code
3. Implement incrementally - small, testable chunks
4. Write tests alongside code
5. Flag complexity - warn if approaching limits
6. **Checkpoint after completing** - update session state

When you notice code violating these rules, **stop and refactor** before continuing.
